description: It's been a while since I started thinking about creating this
  site. Which is just my personal site where I might or might not write about
  what I'm working on my free time. It's not clear yet.

So what about this first post? I don't intend to write a very long dissertation about me or anything else, for that I'll have the about page which I'm still currently working on so, for now, I'll leave it here and pick it back when I have something interesting to say.
