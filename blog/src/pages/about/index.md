I should probably introduce myself, right? Well, my name is Mikel Diez Buil I currently work as a Software Engineer although I never studied Software Engineering nor Computer Science. I'm a Telecommunication Technical Engineer, sounds cool right? It sounds fancier than it actually is.

I'll continue writing tomorrow, thanks for listening I really appreciate it.
